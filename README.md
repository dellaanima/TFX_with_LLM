# TFX_with_LLM

# Description 
This project showcases a machine learning pipeline for fine-tuning sLLM on the Alpaca dataset using TensorFlow Extended (TFX), Vertex AI.   
The fine-tuning process is automated within a TensorFlow Extended (TFX) pipeline. 
The goal is to build a question-answering system using fine-tuned sLLM.
